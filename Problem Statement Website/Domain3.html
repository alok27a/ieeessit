              Waste prevention, recycling, reuse, and recovery are important to
              waste management strategies that ease the burden on landfills
              conserves natural resources, and saves energy. Suggest ways on how
              to spread and implement newwaste disposal practices. You may also
              work on improving the current waste disposal practices to make
              them eco-friendly.

              Metropolitan cities face a common issue of waste management and
              find it difficult to maintain a proper system of waste segregation
              and processing. Municipalities and Treatment plants currently face
              challenges in keeping a track of wastes being picked up by workers
              along with the disposal system incorporated by variousresident
              societies and industries. Put forth a solution that gives a
              coherent system to simplify the process thereby providing
              transparency as well as placing an efficient system into place.
