              Delhi's average AQI(Air Quality Index) today is varying between
              370 to 430, making breathing extremely difficult. The massive
              amount of pollutants in the air is causing an unfortunately huge
              number of diseases of various types within the people living in
              and around Delhi. Even the air inside homes and other enclosed
              areas is of very poor quality. To breathe freely in indoor spaces,
              devise a method which can measure the AQI of the space and switch
              on the mechanisms which can lead to purification of the air inside
              the premesis. (Only detection software and alarm is needed)

              One of the major cause of air pollution these days is vehicle
              emissions. Bharat stage emission standards(BSEs) are emisssion
              standards instituted by the governement of India to regulate the
              pollution due to vehicles. It is controlled by Central Pollution
              Control Board under Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate
              change. In 2020, Bharat Stage VI standards came into picture.
              "While the norms help in bringing down pollution levels, it
              invariably results in increased vehicle cost due to the improved
              technology and higher fuel prices". Explore further about the norm
              and develop a software prototype to regulate the BS VI standard in
              india efficiently. Help GOI in ensuring clean and safe environment
              for sustainable development.
