              Global warming and climate change have become a topic of worry in
              recent times. In addition to this, human energy demands are on the
              rise and our resources are depleting at an alarming rate. Keeping
              this in mind, provide Cost effective and efficient way of
              capturing sunlight by solar panels. You may also suggest an
              innovative system to search for potential sites for solar farms,
              keeping in mind the necessary tools and factors required for the
              same.

              Green cities have become a need of the hour. They are equipped
              with parks and green spaces, solar-powered buildings, rooftop
              gardens and more pedestrians and cyclists than cars. Green
              technology is a key factor that is helping to foster more
              sustainable urban development. It comprises all aspects of city
              planning, including transportation, infrastructure,
              telecommunications and energy. Innovate ways and methods in which
              "green architecture" can reach day-to-day household to contribute
              to sustainable development. (Also include how and why this type of
              architecture should be implemented.)
